Characteristics of Open Source Models

1. Cost: Free to use (No Api costs)
2. Control: Can modify, fine tune and deploy anywhere
3. Data Privacy: Run locally (No data sent to the external servers)
4. Customization: Can fine tune on specific datasets
5. Deployment: Can be deployed on on-premise servers or cloud


Disadvantages:

1. High Hardware Requirements: Running large models (e.g. LLaMa-2-70B) requires expensive GPUs
2. Setup Complexity: Requires installation of dependencies like PyTorch, CUDA, transformers
3. Lack of RLHF: Most open source models don't have fine-tuning with human feedback, making them weaker in instruction-following (The answers that I'm getting is a bit less refined)
4. Limited Multimodal abilities: Open models don't support images, audio or video like GPT-4V
